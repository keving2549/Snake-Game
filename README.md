# Snake-Game
This is a simple Snake Game made in Java using Eclipse designed for an assingment for an Introduction to GUI and Java Course.

## Description

This classic arcade game consists of a snake that is controlled by the user using the arrow  keys. When the snake moves over an apple (consumes it), it increases by 1 in size. The apple randomly spawns on the window and once the snake consumes, it randomly changes location on the window. The user loses the game when the snake hits the edges of the window or when then snake collides with itself, and Game Over is displayed on the sceen, ending the game.
